Music List app

This is a clone/mod of the "Book List" tutorial app by Brad Traversy, made with HTML, Bootstrap, and vanilla JS.

Enter the names of the artist, album, and genre in their respective input fields, and they will be put into a table. Info is saved in local storage.

Future changes I'm thinking of implementing:
- make it Full-Stack, and connect it to a database so music info can be saved
